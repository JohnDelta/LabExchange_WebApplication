# messenger web app

- npm install --save react-stomp
- npm install --save react-route-dom
- npm i sockjs-client
- npm i @stomp/stompjs


- applications must have posts inside only. not the posts too.

- show applications, add remove option

- go to messenger, make it take parameter from url too, and if it has it fetch the rest of the info you want.

- fix the message buttons to open the messenger with the contact. you need to create a queue between the users. nothing else.
even if its empty klain.

- create the service to send notifications data to messenger .... etc
