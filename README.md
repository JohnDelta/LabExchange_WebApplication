### notes


- professor can see all his classes
and if he opens one , see all their assigned labs and option to open for registrations the class.

then he can open a lab and see its state - students - labs

and give choice to download the state for each lab.


- add professor classes and class - labs view 
- add exchanges db and save there
- fix services to check if open for assignments first
- you can open lab and see state
- you can open class and print exchanges
